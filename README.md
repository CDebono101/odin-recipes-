# odin-recipes-
First odin project

In this project i created a webpage with 3 different tabs.
Each tab containing a different recipe.
All recipes contain a Image, a list of ingredients and a list of instructions on how to create the foods.

During this unit i learnt how to create a list, add images and hypertext links to redirect, I also learnt how to create security for the hyper links to stop phishing attacks and tabnabbing.
